            <h2>üß† About ayfresh206</h2>
            What's up, gamers? I'm ayfresh206. You'll usually find me locked into Team Deathmatch on Call of Duty and
            Zero Build in Fortnite. That's where the focus is. If you're into strategic plays with a smooth edge,
            reflexes that are on point, and a community that keeps it chill, then pull up. We can drop in and have some
            laughs, even if my aim sometimes has a mind of its own and my building skills are permanently in the "less
            is more" category. It's all about good vibes and solid games in TDM and Zero Build.

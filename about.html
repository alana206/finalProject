            What's up, gamers? I'm ayfresh206. You'll usually find me locked into Team Deathmatch on Call of Duty and Zero Build in Fortnite. That's where the focus is. If you're into strategic plays with a smooth edge, reflexes that are on point, and a community that keeps it chill, then pull up. We can drop in and have some laughs, even if my aim sometimes has a mind of its own and my building skills are permanently in the "less is more" category. It's all about good vibes and solid games in TDM and Zero Build. </section>
